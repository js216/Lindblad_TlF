    "# Scattering cross sections and branching ratios for mixed states\n",
    "## Intro\n",
    "This notebook calculates the scattering cross sections and branching ratios for transitions between the thallium fluoride X and B states. The eigenstates in the B state are mixed by the electron magnetic hyperfine interaction and thus are best described as superpositions of the basis states of Hunds case (c) ($|I_1, I_2, J, F_1, F, m_F>$). The calculations are mainly done in order to calculate the expected number of photons per molecule for the rotational temperature measurement. The measurement uses the R(J), F = J+1, F' = J+2 transitions so I'm mostly focussing on determining the branching ratios and scattering cross sections between these states."
